A young boy named Malik hears a strange noise he never heard before. As he tries to find what causes the noise, he has to pass the obstacles and fight creatures from the sewer.

Later, he founds out that beneath a busy city of Ningrat Kingdom lies a sewer world of the underdwellers and someone wants to collect the magic kristal that are protecting both worlds.
